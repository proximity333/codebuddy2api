/**
 * Image generation for the Responses API.
 *
 * Both reference clients disagree here, so this mirrors the one that has a
 * protocol: OpenAI's Responses API exposes `image_generation` as a tool the
 * model invokes, returning an `image_generation_call` output item whose
 * `result` is base64. Anthropic has no equivalent, and CodeBuddy's own CLI
 * calls a separate `/v2/images/generations` endpoint.
 *
 * The two upstream protocols therefore need different handling:
 *
 * - `responses` passthrough forwards the tool declaration untouched, because
 *   CodeBuddy's `/responses` endpoint accepts `image_generation` natively and
 *   streams `image_generation_call` items back.
 * - `chat` has no such concept, so the declaration is rewritten into an
 *   ordinary function and the call is executed here against
 *   `/v2/images/generations`, with the result fed back as a tool message.
