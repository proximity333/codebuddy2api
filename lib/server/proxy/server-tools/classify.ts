/**
 * Decides which tool declarations the provider — this proxy — is meant to run,
 * and rewrites them into functions upstream can call.
 *
 * ## Only the declared type counts
 *
 * A provider-executed tool is declared with a type of its own: Anthropic sends
 * `web_search_20250305` and `web_fetch_20250910`, the Responses API sends
 * `web_search_preview`. A client's own function is declared as
 * `{type: 'function', function: {...}}` on OpenAI, or as a bare
 * `{name, input_schema}` with no type at all on Anthropic. So the type is both
 * necessary and sufficient to tell them apart.
 *
 * The name is deliberately never consulted. `normalizeToolName` strips case and
 * separators — `WebSearch` and `web_search` both become `websearch` — so a
 * name-based test cannot tell Claude Code's own `WebSearch` function from the
 * server tool. Matching on the name made the proxy answer a call the client had
 * every intention of resolving itself: Claude Code never received the
 * `tool_use` block it needed, so the search it asked for never happened and the
 * turn ended with an answer invented from memory.
 *
 * The distinction is what the corrected flow turns on. Claude Code declares
 * `WebSearch` as an ordinary function and resolves it itself; only when it has
 * a `WebSearch` result to fill in does it issue a sub-request whose tools carry
 * the server type, and that sub-request is the one that runs here.
