/**
 * Browserable backend — a self-hostable browser agent.
 *
 * The address is expected to be an absolute `http(s)` URL; the registry checks
 * that before building this, because a provider that cannot be built is one the
 * deployment should not advertise.
 *
 * The reason to pick it is reach: it drives a real browser, so pages that
 * refuse a plain fetch still come back — scripted pages, pages behind a login
 * the instance already holds, pages that block datacentre addresses. The cost
 * is latency, which is an order of magnitude worse than a direct fetch, so it
 * belongs in the middle or end of a fetch chain rather than at the front.
 *
 * The deployment needs an address; the API key is optional because a
 * self-hosted instance is commonly reachable without one.
 *
 * The exchange follows Browserable's REST API: create a task from an
 * instruction, then poll that task until it reports a result. Task ids and
 * result bodies are read from several field names, and the result is looked for
 * both on a task-specific path and on the task itself, because the API spells
 * both in more than one way across versions. A deployment whose paths differ
 * can be reached by giving its full address — any path prefix is kept as-is.
