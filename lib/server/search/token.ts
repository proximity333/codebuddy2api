/**
 * Supplies a CodeBuddy bearer token to the agent-tool backends.
 *
 * The agent-tool endpoints (`/agenttool/v1/search`, `/agenttool/v1/webfetch`)
 * authenticate with the same credential as the model endpoint, so the gateway
 * already has what they need — but only for the duration of a request. This
 * module bridges that: the proxy sets the credential backing the current
 * request, and the backends read it through an ambient token.
 *
 * `AsyncLocalStorage` is what makes the ambient handoff safe. The registry
 * resolves providers once and caches them, so a provider outlives any single
 * request; passing a token through the provider's constructor would freeze
 * whichever credential happened to be first. Storing it per-request instead
 * means a concurrent request cannot observe another's token, and a rotated
 * credential takes effect on the next call.
