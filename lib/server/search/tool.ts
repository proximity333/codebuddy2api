 * Anthropic declares server-side search as a dated tool *type*

 * The OpenAI Responses API used by Codex declares it as the type
 * `web_search_preview`. Both mean "the provider should run a web search", and
 * neither exists upstream, so both are matched here.
 *
 * `web_fetch` follows the same pattern: Anthropic ships it as
 * `web_fetch_20250910` and Responses clients send a plain function tool named
 * `web_fetch`. Upstream has no such server tool, so the proxy executes it
 * locally exactly as it does search.
