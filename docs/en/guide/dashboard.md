# Dashboard

Open Dashboard after signing in to confirm that the proxy and credential pool are ready.

## What you see

- **Total credentials** and the number marked **active**.
- **Calls today**, **Tokens today**, and **Cache-hit tokens today**.
- **API endpoint**, the `/v1` base URL for clients.

## First use

1. If no credentials are active, open **Credentials** and complete authentication.
2. Copy the **API endpoint**, then create an API key in **Credentials**.
3. Configure your client with the endpoint and key.
4. Use **API Test** to send a first request.

## Install it as an app

The console is a PWA, so browsers offer to install it; the installed icon opens the console, or the sign-in page when you are signed out.

- Desktop Chrome or Edge: the install icon at the right of the address bar, or "Install CodeBuddy2API" in the menu.
- iOS Safari: Share → Add to Home Screen.
- Browsers only offer installation over HTTPS, or on localhost.
- Installing it only adds an entry point: pages are not cached, so when the gateway is unreachable the app simply cannot reach it — there is no offline content to fall back on.
